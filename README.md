# APITaskDataEng31

For this task, I have used a publicly accessible API called 'ExchangeRate-API' to build a basic script
that retrieves the exchange rate of any currency vis-a-vis the four main reserve currencies (USD, GBP, EUR and JPY).

To use the script, simply enter the code of any currency whose exchange rate you want to know when you are prompted.
